# cloudstack
public repo to install cloudstack on ubuntu distro's. The main purpose is to easily deploy a cloudstack environment.
This is based on the documentation provided by cloudstack with some testing done on servers.
There are other ways to install this by for example Ansible, but for my usecase, I was able to deploy this with cloudinit bootscripts, and don't need that much manual work and dependencies.
